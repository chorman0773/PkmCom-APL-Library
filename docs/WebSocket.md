# Pkmcom/WebSocket

In addition to TCP, Pkmcom supports WebSockets as a valid Base Protocol. Both WebSocket (ws) and WebSocket with TLS (wss) are valid underlying implementations. Client Implementations which support Pkmcom/WebSocket are required to support wss but are not required to support ws. Servers may choose which to support. It is highly recommended that servers soley support wss or support both. 

WebSocket is defined by [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).
