# PkmCom-APL-Library

Java Library for the APL of PkmCom, including lan pipes and  PkmCom/Multicast UDP.

This Library allows for the creation of various applications which use PkmCom APL in various manners, including the Original TCP Specification, the modified Specification for PkmCom/Multicast UDP, and internal pipe connections for Clients Hosting LAN. 
The Protocol was originally designed for the Pokemon Fangame, PokemonSMS (see <https://github.com/chorman0773/PokemonSMS-Public-Specification>). A Copy of the TCP APL will be provided there. In the future, copies of the TCP APL, Multicast UDP APL, and possibly a Unicast UDP APL will be provided in this repository, along with the Java Code.
